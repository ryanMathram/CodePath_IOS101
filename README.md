## App Brainstorming (Step 4)

Tiktok
 - In the friends tab, they post a friend's story in the form of a post

 - From the notifications, you can see which account messages have been sent to you and the user who sent you that message
 - The colors throughou tthe app with a mixture between purple, pink, orange, and yellow create a really good mix and keeps consistent user retension

My new app that I am thinking to develop is called Grammer where it has a relliable and consistent form of content such as Tiktok towards each user while enabling users to
to message between friends just like Instgram. Although this idea is sort of what Instagram's whole main idea, Instagram is missing a key detail, the user retention which tiktok
brings to it's app. I would like to implement close cut details like the repost section which Tiktok has but also create a app with new sets of vibrate colors just like Instagram
